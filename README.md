Reaction Time Test Game
Overview
This project is a simple Reaction Time Test Game where users can test how fast they respond to visual stimuli. The user must wait for the screen to turn green and then click as quickly as possible. The game measures the user's reaction time in milliseconds and provides an average reaction time after three attempts.

Features
Simple and intuitive user interface.
Reaction time is measured in milliseconds (ms).
Average reaction time is calculated and displayed after three attempts.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
How to Play
The game will display a random delay before the background color changes to green.
Wait for the screen to turn green, then click as fast as possible.
Your reaction time in milliseconds (ms) will be displayed.
You will get three tries, and at the end, the average reaction time of all three attempts will be displayed.
Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:

index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
style.css: The CSS file that defines the layout and design of the page.
main.js: The JavaScript file that handles the game logic, including calculating reaction time and displaying the results.
Future Improvements
Add more levels with increasing difficulty.
Allow users to share their reaction times on social media.
Implement a leaderboard to compare scores with other players.
